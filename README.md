# Midterm Project 2019

Your project is to write, in teams of three students, a Python
molecular dynamics (MD) code to simulate a droplet of liquid Argon. We
want to study how varying some of the simulation parameters affects
the accuracy of the simulations and extract thermodynamic properties
from the simulations. You will write a short "letter"-style paper to
communicate, discuss and summarize your reasoning and your results.

For details see [project_2.pdf](project_2.pdf). **Note the
requirements for code and report** and note what constitutes
admissable collaboration between teams.

Starter code is available in directory [code/](code).

## Submission

1. Create three sub-directories `Submission`, `Grade`, and `Work`.
2. You can try out code in the `Work` directory but you don’t have to
   use it if you don’t want to. Your grade with comments will appear
   in `Grade`.
3. Create your solution in `Submission`. Use `git` to `git add` files
   and `git commit` changes.  
   
   You can create a PDF file or Jupyter notebook inside the
   `Submission` directory as well as Python code. Name your files
   `project2.pdf` or or `project2.ipynb`, depending on how you format
   your work. Files with code (if requested) should be named exactly
   as required in the assignment.
4. When you are ready to submit your solution, do a final `git status`
   to check that you haven’t forgotten anything, commit any uncom-
   mitted changes, and `git push` to your GitHub repository. **Check on
   your GitHub repository web page that your files were properly
   submitted.**
   
   You can push more updates up until the deadline. Changes after the
   deadline will not be taken into account for grading.
